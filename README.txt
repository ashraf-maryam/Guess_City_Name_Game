Final Project Description:
I wrote a project called Guess the City Name. It gives you a description about a city and the user needs to guess the city. The user gets three chances to guess the correct answer before they get zero points and move to the next question. There will be three questions for every question for a total of three points per question but with with every wrong guess one points get deducted from the possible points win per question until it gets zero.
